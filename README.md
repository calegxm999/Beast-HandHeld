# Beast-HandHeld
Like a PS Vita but better!
You will be able to make games for it without excessive licensing or cost, and I want it to be able to emulate windows.


Long Description:
I will develop a game console which is like the PS Vita but more powerful, mainly because Sony gave up on the PS Vita, and to me that was a disappointment.

You're probably wondering why there are no files in this repsitory, and that is because I don't need any yet, it's just an acknowledgement to the community about it.....

And before anyone suggests this, it's not named after Mr Beast the youtuber..... It's because it will be a beast (Very powerful (Hopefully more powerful than the switch))
